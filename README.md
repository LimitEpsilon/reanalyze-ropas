# reanalyze-ropas

This repository utilizes the frontend developed in [reanalyze](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), and attempts to improve upon the exception analysis features that reanalyze provides. The dead-code elimination and termination analysis features are not yet implemented and are kept in their original forms. The code for exception analysis is licensed under the MIT [license](src/exa/LICENSE).
