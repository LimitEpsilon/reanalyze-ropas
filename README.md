# reanalyze-ropas

This repository utilizes the frontend developed in [reanalyze](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), and attempts to improve upon the exception analysis feature that reanalyze provides. The dead-code elimination and termination analysis features are not yet implemented and are kept in their original forms. The code of the original reanalyze repository and the code for exa are licensed under the MIT [license](LICENSE).
